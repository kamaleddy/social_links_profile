## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-Created clickable social media links with # placeholders (could be replaced with real URLs later)

```html
<li><a href="#">Instagram</a></li>
```

-Applied clamp() for responsive design

```css
main {
  width: clamp(20em, 90%, 25em);
}
```

### Continued development

- Adding subtle animations on hover to improve visual style
- Use shadows or gradients to give depth to cards and buttons.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - This helped me to understand how the CSS function clamp() works.
